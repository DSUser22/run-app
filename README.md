# run-app

This app can help people to prepare for a marathon. It creates plan depended on the date of marathon, how many times a week you want to train(3-5) and your last running distance.
It contains registration with confirmation letters, authentification, creating plan and getting trainings with dates and distances.
There are 4 type of training: 
- speed running
- ordinary running
- long running
- gym (if you want to train 5 times a week).


By default, start of preparing is beginning of next week or if today is Monday - this week; and as usual date of marathon is sunday, so app consider this.

This is backend, app is RESTful. It is simple, but not perfect. Hope you enjoy not using Excel for creating your plan :)
